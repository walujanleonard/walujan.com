On 9 & 11 December 2023, I and several students of Informatics Engineering at Manado State Polytechnic, 2021 generation participating in community service activities in Rurukan, South Tomohon, North Sulawesi precisely at SMP Kristen Rurukan.

In this activity, we were given the opportunity to take part in installing the internet network. Since the school already has a fiber optic internet network, our main task was to extend the reach of the wireless network using access points.

## Network topology

Here is a picture of the network topology that will be applied to our main task in this community service activity.

Based on the picture above, there will be a router and two access points.

## Activity on 9 December 2023

On 9 December 2023, which was the first day of this community service activity, our first task was to configure the Router and Access Point that would be donated to the school. For the router we use MikroTik and our access point uses TP-Link. Leonard Walujan will act and be responsible as a network administrator until the activity is completed.

As a network administrator, the first thing I did was to reset the configuration on the router and then start configuring the router starting from IP Address, Wireless, Firewall, and Hotspot. However, it was not only me who configured the network on the router, of course there were also my friends when I was setting up the access point. After configuring the router, next I started configuring the access point.

This access point aims to transmit signals from the router, where the access point will be placed in the computer lab and the teacher's room.

After the access point was configured, next I started testing whether the access point could transmit the network from the router or not. After I tested it, finally the access point was finished and a second trial will be carried out where the access point will be installed to the previously mentioned place to ensure that it can transmit signals from the router.

Next, we started making Ethernet cables, these cables will be used to connect between the access point and the router. In this second task we will make an Ethernet cable to connect the access point from the teacher's room to the router first.

After the cable was made, we started to connect and test the access point directly to the teacher's room to ensure that it was actually transmitting the network through the router.

After conducting tests by connecting mobile devices to the network and monitoring through the MikroTik router, we have finally succeeded in transmitting a wireless network to the teacher's room, although during the creation process we experienced difficulties, of course, compared to doing the first task, namely configuring routers and access points.

## Activity on 11 December 2023

On 11 December 2023, before going to the service site, we went to campus first to attend lectures. After the lecture activities were over, we started going to the place of service because we had to continue the second task that had not been completed, namely transmitting the network to the school computer lab room after the teacher's room.

When we arrived at the place of service, we waited for the arrival of the principal for a few minutes while talking with the IT operator at the school, starting from discussing the tasks we would continue and solving the problems as well.

After the principal arrived, we started putting the tools away and continued making Ethernet cables to connect the access points that would be installed to the computer lab rooms and I as the network administrator would do the monitoring for a router.

This process took a long time because of difficulties, and when we wanted to bring the Ethernet cable to the lab room, we still had to discuss to solve the problem of how to get the cable into the lab room because the distance between the router and the access point in the lab room was quite far. In this section I did not have time to take some documentation because we had to focus on doing the task.

While others were working on expanding the wireless network coverage, I took the time to educate the teachers who acted as IT operators on how the routers and access points worked, how to access them, and also provided other IT education that might be useful in the future.

After that, I did some monitoring and finally when I checked the list of IP addresses it turned out that the access point was able to connect and someone was already testing the internet connection, so I started going there to see where they put the access point. I didn't have time to documenting this part.

Next, we took a group photo with the teacher because this documentation is proof that we have completed the tasks assigned during the community service activity. We feel relieved because we have been able to make it easier for teachers and students to access wireless networks in the school environment.

This is the end of the story of our activities, hopefully we will get the opportunity to participate in community service activities in the future.
