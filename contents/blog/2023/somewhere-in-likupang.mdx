On 7 October 2023, I went to Likupang not for a vacation, but to do research in some tourist attractions with lecturers, professors, and other students. While on duty, I took the chance to take some photos of the scenery because I like to take some photos to make memories.

You can see some photos I took below.

## Bangka Island

Around half past 9am, we arrived at Likupang Harbor and prepared to get into the boat and continue our journey to the island. 30 minutes later, we started to enter the island, Bangka Island. While we were at sea and had not yet started our data collection task, I took the chance to take some photos of the scenery on the island. Although I didn't take all the photos on the island, at least I was able to take some good photos in my own opinion.

After doing research on Bangka Island, around half past 1pm, we started to go to Batu Mandi, which was our last place to collect data. This place has a beautiful underwater view Unfortunately, my friend and I couldn't go there to take data because there were already students in other majors who were given the task of taking underwater photos, so we could only take some photos on land.

## Closing

Some of the places I took photos are in Likupang, North Sulawesi, Indonesia. For the best experience, go there when the weather is clear.
