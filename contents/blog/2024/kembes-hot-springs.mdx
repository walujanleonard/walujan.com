Kembes Hot Springs is located in the hills of Kembes Dua, North Sulawesi, Indonesia. The first time I went to this place was on 20 November 2020, going to this place takes time and effort because the road will often go up the hill. This place can be called a hidden place too because it requires a clue to know the way in. Since I've been there more than once so I can more easily recall the route.

In this post, I'm sharing stories from the same place but at different times based on the documentation I have.

## 20 November 2020

On 20 November 2020, I woke up at around 3am and gathered somewhere with my friends so that we could go to the hot spring together. The day before, we had planned to go there by preparing everything that would be needed when in the hot spring later.

We went there before sunrise, so that we wouldn't get tired easily during the journey. Halfway there, we took a short break and enjoyed the view of Manado City, which was lit up because it was still dark when we went there. After that, we continued our journey there. The sun was starting to rise, and we were at the entrance to the hot spring. By passing through several obstacles, we finally arrived at the hot spring safely.

Once we were there, we started trying to enjoy the place. After breakfast, I immediately took the time to documenting the place, because this place has two parts, above and below. After taking some photos below, me and some of my friends started to go up to see the next view.

When we got to the top, we immediately saw where the hot water flowed. The water temperature was much hotter than at the bottom because of the mix of hot and cold water. It was not a suitable place for us to bathe. Here, I also took the time to document the hot spring with the sunny morning weather of course.

A few hours later after enjoying the hot springs, we started preparing to leave the place and finally headed home. On the way back, we talked while looking at the scenery.

## 14 January 2024

Previously, I had gone to the hot spring with my neighbourhood friends for the second time in June 2022. Since the documentation has been lost, I can only share the first and third documentation.

_This section is a continuation of the previous story, namely:_ <Link href={"/blog/2024/rok-rok-kembes-waterfall-2024"} className="hover:underline">**Rok Rok Kembes Waterfall (2024)**</Link>

On 14 January 2024, after taking documentation and enjoying the Rok Rok Kembes Waterfall, my friend and I continued our journey to Kembes Hot Springs, which is the place is on a different path. Because the path was different, my friend and I had to exit the waterfall entrance, and continue up the hill again.

This was quite a challenge for me because going to the hot spring in cloudy and rainy weather, when halfway there it started raining heavily, would not stop me from getting to my destination. On the way, I tried to remember the entrance, needing to look for clues that could determine that I was already at the entrance to the hot spring. Finally, I was able to find the entrance.

Because it was raining, my friend and I had to be careful because it was slippery at the entrance, but by entering slowly and carefully, we finally reached our destination even though I slipped.

My friend started to enjoy the hot spring, especially since it was still raining which made my friend like to enjoy this place for a long time. Then, I took the time to take documentation starting from the bottom first. After taking the documentation and my friend finished enjoying the hot spring at the bottom, I invited my friend to look at the top where the hot water flows.

The water temperature at the top was very hot and not suitable for bathing there. So I could only see and feel a little bit of the water, and took some documentation. A few minutes later, my friend and I started to go down after taking the documentation and then prepared to get out of the place and go home. On the way back, we were careful because it was still raining while talking and looking at the scenery.

## Closing

This Hot Spring has some changes when I go there every two years starting from 2020, 2022, 2024. If you have already go there, you only need a clue that can recall the entrance. If it's your first time going to the hot spring, you might need someone with you that already experienced to guide you there.
