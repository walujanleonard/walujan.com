After passing the selection to become an outstanding student for the campus level, I was given the opportunity to participate in the selection of outstanding student competition activities for the regional level at Gorontalo University.

## Story

On 6 May 2024, the day before the event started, my lecturer and I departed from Manado to Gorontalo in the morning. After more than 10 hours of travelling by car, we finally arrived in Gorontalo City in the evening. When we arrived, we started to stay at the hotel and prepare something that needed to be brought and presented later.

On 7 May 2024, I woke up at 5am to prepare myself to go to Gorontalo University in Gorontalo Regency with my lecturer.

At around 8am, we finally arrived at the campus to attend the regional outstanding student selection competition. This was my first time participating in an activity like this because each participant came from a different campus. However, this became my opportunity to make relations and friends between campuses as well. In this activity, each participant will present excellent achievements, creative ideas, and English.

After taking a group photo for the opening ceremony with all the participants, I took a group photo with my lecturer.

The competition activities have begun, each participant will come forward to take a number, which participants will advance to the room based on the order of the numbers obtained.

When I took the number, I finally still had quite a long time to prepare myself to present it in the room.

After waiting for about 1 hour more, I was finally called to present it in the room, which I will present my excellent achievements first according to my serial number.

When I presented my excellent achievements, I was given 10 minutes to present them. During my presentation, I presented my academic and non-academic achievements. After presenting it, I was faced with several questions, although there were questions that would be my shortcomings, I was able to wrap it up with my other strengths and also I took the opportunity to present my personal website as well there to share other achievements that I listed. After that, I was finally able to complete the presentation of my excellent achievements well and safely, all the questions given I was able to answer them nicely.

After I presented my excellent achievements, I took the time to introduce and interact with the participants while waiting to get my turn to present the next part. After more than an hour of waiting, I finally got my turn to present in English.

When I presented in English, I presented my excellent achievements first and then I presented my creative ideas. After presenting these two things, I was given questions related to my excellent achievements and creative ideas and I answered them all in English. Finally, I was able to answer all the questions well. After that, I waited for about a few minutes after the presentation in English to present the creative ideas.

After waiting for a few minutes, I got my turn to present a creative idea. When I presented my creative idea, I was given 10 minutes to present it and answer the questions that would be given. When I presented a creative idea, I presented starting from the scope of discussion, problems, solutions, and output targets on the creative idea. After that, I was given a question with only 1 minute left. However, I was able to answer them well even though I was not optimal in presenting a creative idea.

Finally, I was able to present the 3 parts only on this first day. Next, the lecturer and I started to leave the venue to return to the hotel, and in the evening the lecturer and I attended a social gathering with the participants, lecturers, and organisers.

On 8 May 2024, I woke up a little late because I had presented everything on the first day. I arrived at the venue around half past 11am and almost missed the group photo with the other participants. After taking a group photo, I started interacting with them with random things. Next, the host participant invited me and other participants to take a tour around the campus.

While touring around the campus, we talk together and laughed about what we were discussing while we were seeing the environment of the campus and of course we also did some fun things there. After the tour, we took another group photo and then returned to our original place.

When we returned to our original places, each of us continued to talk about random things, while the judges held a meeting to determine who would be the champion and qualify for the national level. A few hours later, the committee invited all participants to practice parading quickly so that when the judges arrived, we could parade optimally.

After the parade practice, some participants including myself were invited to take part in the line dance, although I was still lacking in doing it, I think it was cool because I did it together with other participants which may not happen again in the future.

Next, some of the participants took a break and some took the time to sing until the judges finished their meeting. A few minutes later, the judges arrived and we went straight into the parade and it was finally the best it could be.

After the parade, we immediately heard speeches as well as announcing who won and was entitled to participate in the national level competition. In this section only 5 participants will be selected to participate in the national level (3 from undergraduate and 2 from vocational). When they announced the results, all participants had the best results, but only a few participants were entitled to qualify for the national level.

When they announced the winners, unfortunately I wasn't mentioned which meant I couldn't win and qualify for the national stage, but I didn't feel too sorry. After that, all participants and lecturers also received certificates for participating in this activity successfully. This certificate motivated me because whatever the result, I was able to do my best and at least there was no lack of response when I presented the three parts.

**After the activity was over, what was the next activity?**

After leaving the venue, I was invited by my host to go on a tour in the evening and I accepted and of course the lecturer also accepted the invitation. A few hours later, the organiser finally came and took us to the lake located in Bone Bolango Regency. On this last day, we spent time to do a tour until midnight in Bone Bolango Regency along with several other participants who were still staying because there were already several participants starting to return to their respective places of origin. On 9 May 2024, my lecturer and I officially left Gorontalo and returned to our hometown.

## Closing

The Regional Outstanding Student Selection event at Gorontalo University gave me a rare experience, because there is a small chance that I can meet them again even though I can still connect via the internet. However, it is also better if we meet together in person.

In this activity, we all come not only about competing, but also bring relationships and friendships, especially since all participants excel in their respective fields of interest which of course can be a motivation for each participant in the future. This activity certainly also brings a sense of longing too.

I congratulate the participants who qualify for the national stage, hopefully they can bring very maximum results.
