On 14 January 2024, I went to the Rok Rok Kembes Waterfall together with my friend who wanted to enjoy the natural beauty of the Kembes village for the first time. This has been planned since November 2023 but was postponed several times due to their respective busy schedules and finally the plan was successfully implemented.

I went there at 12pm with cloudy weather conditions by my friend who wanted to enjoy the place, of course I became a tour guide who would guide my friend starting from determining the route and providing other information in order to arrive at the destination safely.

Apart from being a tour guide for my friend, of course I went there to re-document the place and it happened to be cloudy and rainy again which is definitely a difference between the first documentation that I have published on my website.

When we got there, my friend immediately explored and took a little documentation and enjoyed the place for a few minutes. Although the weather conditions were cloudy and rainy, of course this would not hinder my process in completing my main goal of taking documentation of the place again.

## Photography
